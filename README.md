# contacts-python  
Created by Frederico Campos Freitas  
This is a set of scripts to evaluate the number of contacts in a GROMACS-SMOG simulation. Some features were implemented to fit our needs, so feel free to make any changes in order to tailor the scripts to your needs.  
It relies on mdtraj, so you will need it installed alongside the numpy library.  
You may find some useful information in the comments of each script.  
Feel free to contact us if you need some help: fredcfreitas(at)gmail.com
