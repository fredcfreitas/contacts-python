# contacts-python
Created by Frederico Campos Freitas
This is a set of scripts to evaluate the number of contacts in any simulation. Some features were implemented to fit our needs, feel free to do any of your appreciation.
It relies on mdtraj, so you will need it installed alongside the numpy library.
